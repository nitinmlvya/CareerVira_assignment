 (60) (a) - The GDPR requires us to tell you about the legal ground we're relying on to process any Personal Data about you. The legal grounds for us processing your Personal Data for the purposes set out in Section 1 above will typically be because:
 (61) •   you provided your consent;
 (62) •   it is necessary for our contractual relationship;
 (63) •   the processing is necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations; and/or

 (70)  For the most part, you can you can exercise these rights by logging in and visiting the My Profile page under your account settings or through the Self-Service portal for attendees, changing the ""cookie settings"" in your browser. You can also request a copy of your data as set forth in Section 11. Please note that requests to exercise data protection rights will be assessed by us on a case-by-case basis.

doc6," (71) (d) - Eventzilla as a Data Controller and a Data Processor
 (72) EU data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as ""Data Controllers"") and organizations that process Personal Data on behalf of other organizations (known as ""Data Processors""). If you have a question or complaint about how your Personal Data is handled, these should always be directed to the relevant Data Controller since they are the ones with primary responsibility for your Personal Data.
 (73) Eventzilla may act as either a Data Controller or a Data Processor in respect of your Personal Data, depending on the circumstances.
 (74) For example, if you create an account with us to organize your events, Eventzilla will be a Data Controller in respect of the Personal Data that you provide as part of your account.
 (75) Similarly, if you are a Consumer who registered to attend an event though the Service and also explicitly registered to Eventzilla Attendees Mobile App, which is the app designated for attendees of events, or the Self Service Portal for attendees, which is where attendees can access the Services to take certain actions without assistance by Eventzilla, then Eventzilla will be a Data Controller in respect of the Personal Data that you provide as part of your account.
 (76) We will also be a Data Controller of the Personal Data that we have obtained about the use of the Applications, or Eventzilla Properties, which could relate to Organizers or Consumers. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “Applications” shall include any mobile or web-based applications on which the Services are accessible to Users, and “Eventzilla Properties” shall constitute those properties listed on the Platform.We use this to conduct research and analysis to help better understand and serve Users of the Services as well as to improve our Platform and provide you with more targeted recommendations about events we think may be of interest to you.
 (77) However, if you register for an event as a Consumer, we will process your Personal Data to help administer that event on behalf of the Organizer (for example, sending confirmation, promotional and feedback emails, processing payments, etc.) and to help the Organizer target, and understand the success of, their event and event planning (for example, providing event reports, using analytics to gain insights into the effectiveness of various sales channels, etc.). In these circumstances, Eventzilla merely provides the ""tools"" for Organizers; Eventzilla does not decide what Personal Data to request on registration forms, nor is it responsible for the continued accuracy any Personal Data provided. Any questions that you may have relating to your Personal Data and your rights under data protection law should therefore be directed to the Organizer as the Data Controller, not to Eventzilla.",JURISDICTION,,,,,

Cookies may also endure for different periods of time. “Session cookies” only last only as long as your browser or app is open.

Pixel tags can also be used to monitor the way in which visitors interact with websites, electronic communications and the content thereon/in. Pixels also provide the means by which third-party partners set and read browser cookies from a domain that they do not themselves operate and collect information about visitors to that domain, typically with the permission of the domain owner. “Software Development Kits” (also called SDKs) function like pixels and cookies, but operate in the mobile app context where pixels and cookies cannot always function.
